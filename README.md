# utils-for-QC aka qutils 

This is my personal library, where I'll be storing useful functions for Quantum Computing/quantum information. It's my personal snippet library. Initially it'll be messy but overtime (hopefully) it will get better and more organized (maybe uniform structure will be introduced).
